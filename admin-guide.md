# Administration resources
> This guide is intended for System Administrators or personnel in charge of managing an instance of **on_board**. If you are an advisor, or a student, please refer to the corresponding documentation using the sidebar menu.

## Institution Setup
This is an important section of the overall system, as the information here will be used by students to communicate with your Institution right from within on_board.
To get your Institution's contact information in the system simply:
1. **As an Administrator**, Go to Settings > Institution
2. Enter all necessary information, then click **Save**.

## Front Page Setup
By default, when you navigate to your *on_board* instance you will be presented with the login screen.
In some occasions it may be important to showcase any kind of information related to your organization.

Fortunately, this is something very easy to do here :wink:.
1. **As an Administrator**, Go to Settings > Front Page.
2. Paste or manually enter your HTML content here, then click **Save**.
3. Done! Now when you go to https://your-on_board.com you will be greeted with the content you just added.

## Working with Orientations
> It may seem overwhelming but really, is not. We made it an easy for administrators to work with orientations.

In this section you will learn how to create and edit orientations, add and edit sections, enroll students, and view and export reports on student progress by orientation.

1. Go to your Dashboard, then click **New** on the header of the Orientations card.
2. Enter a name, description, and language, then click **Save**. *(The language field is for informative purposes only.

### Editing the orientation settings
